# Mike Hughes

I am a Senior Lecturer in Applied Optics at the University of Kent.

I work on optical imaging techniques, including endoscopic microscopy, holographic microscopy and optical coherence tomogaphy (OCT), focusing on (1) imaging through fibres and (2) computational techniques. I also teach courses on the various physics and astronomy programmes at Kent.

These repositories are mostly focused on optical imaging, as well as a few related to undergraduate physics teaching, plus the odd side project.
